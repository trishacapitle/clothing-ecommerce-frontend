## Case Study

While browsing through hundreds of e-commerce UI designs on figma for my next front-end project, I came across this particular design that I think will represent the entirety of most e-commerce layout and designs out there, a simple template layout of a clothing e-commerce website. I decided to use React + Vite and TailwindCSS and added minimal yet satisfying hover interactions, I also added iconic scrolling banner using react-fast-marquee.

### Built with
